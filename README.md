Taken from Sebastian Lague in this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHeQ8Hr92P4) and expanded on.

## Goodies

* Mario Galaxy Type of Gravity
* Planets can get a mass automatically derived from their density and size
* Jet-pack type of jump or "hold to increase" type of jump

## License

Sebastian didn't specify a license so I'm going to go on a limb and say MIT
